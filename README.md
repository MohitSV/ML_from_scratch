# Machine Learning From Scratch 🤖

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python. Each algorithm is implemented without using ML libraries to understand the core concepts.

## Implemented Algorithms 🛠️

- **Decision Trees**: Using Gini impurity for splits 🌳
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Basic distance-based classification 🎯
- **Neural Networks**: Feedforward and backpropagation implementation 🧠
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with bootstrapping and bagging 🌲

## Datasets Used 📊
The implementations have been tested on common datasets including:
- Iris dataset 🌸
- House votes dataset 🗳️
- Wine Quality dataset 🍷
- Parkinson's disease dataset 🏥
- MNIST dataset ✍️

## Dependencies 📦
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
